<h2>Directions</h2>
<h7>To make your Bibimbap (Korean Rice With Mixed Vegetables), follow these two simple steps:</h7>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Step 1</h4><h7>In a bowl, stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste.</h7></li>
  <li><h4>Step 2</h4><h7>Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce.</h7></li>
  <li><h4>Step 3</h4><h7>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl.</h7></li>
  <li><h4>Step 4</h4><h7>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, 4 - 5 minutes per side.</h7></li>
  <li><h4>Step 5</h4><h7>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 3 to 4 minutes.</h7></li>
  <li><h4>Step 6</h4><h7>Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg on top of each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</h7></li>
